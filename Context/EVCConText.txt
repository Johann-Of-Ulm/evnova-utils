The discoveries that made faster-than-light travel possible brought us untold riches...\r\r...and unknown dangers.\r\rThe alien warships appeared without warning and decimated most of the outer colony worlds within hours. There was no stopping the mysterious alien menace.\r\rThe Great War was upon us.\r\rBut we beat them. The human race banded together into a powerful confederation of worlds, whose combined military strength was enough to turn the tide of the War.\r\rWithin eight years, the enigmatic alien marauders were extinct.\r\rBut the elite and powerful members of the Confederation were reluctant to give up their power after the end of the War, and began a rule of oppression and tyranny, aided by the powerful Confederation Navy.\r\rThey exploited the outer colony planets for the benefit of the wealthy Core Worlds, stripping them of their resources and coercing the colonists into forced labor.\r\rThis reign of terror lasted for fifteen years; then the insurrection began.\r\rThe outer colonies, weary of the Confederation’s practices of exploiting their land and denying them any representation in the Senate, formed an organized rebellion aimed at destroying their oppressors.\r\rIn time, their pitiful forces grew, with the help of sympathetic corporations, into a formidable navy.\r\rThe galactic civil war still rages on, and no end is in sight.\r\rFor a brave and resourceful starship pilot, the stars are filled with untold opportunities...\r\r...and unknown threats.\r\rAfter years of serving as the first mate of an ore freighter, you have finally scraped together enough credits to buy your own ship, a small but sturdy cargo shuttle.\r\rYou begin your journey orbiting the neutral port of Levo, a backwater world of islands and ocean.\r\rThe rest of the galaxy awaits you, offering great wealth or a quick death.\r\rYour actions will decide which.\r\rGood luck, captain.\r"	"•"
