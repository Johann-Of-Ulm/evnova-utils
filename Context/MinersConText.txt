It features four Ion Bolt Cannons and can be outfitted with various missiles and rockets. Because the Acheron was originally designed for ferrying important people or precious cargo, it features four, independent external shield generators (the coils). These generators can be used in several modes: 1. 4-layer mode, projecting four weak layers around the ship; 2. 2-layer mode, projekting two medium-strength layers around the ship; 3. 1-layer mode, projecting one strong layer around the ship; 4. IntACS-mode (Intelligent Anti Collision System), projecting an extremely strong, focused shield layer between itself and the closest object that endangers the ship via collision (e. g. asteroids, missiles).

And they suit it well. The Accipiter doesn't feature too good shields, but it can dodge most shots easily. In addition to the cannons, the Accipiter can be outfitted with various rockets or missiles. In the occassion the ship gets stranded somewhere in a distant sector, it features a powerfull phalanx of solar cells on top to recharge its energy banks. The first version had a small problem with the thrusters. Because of a rerooting mistake, the right thruster was slightly stronger then the left during the use of the afterburner. However, the actual version doesn't have this problem any longer."	"•"

Armed with 12 Flame Bolt Turrets, four huge Ion Pulse Cannons and two multifunctional launchers, the Destroyer can really kick some butt. Although not necessary, four turn jet phalanxes were added to increase the ship's maneuverability. The four large engines give it some good acceleration and high speed. Actually this is Mk.II. Although no visible changes have been made, several things have been improved. An example is that the original hypercom device has been replaced by a far more capable Dakkar-com device."	"•"

Although its size and weight, the Erebus still features almost fighter-like maneuverability. This is guaranteed by the two turn jet phalanxes on the engines. The Erebus is usually used together with fighters. While the Erebus attacks large ships, the escorts defend it from enemy fighters, as the Erebus is still too slow to defend itself from too fast crafts."	"•"

Although the basic weaponary is not very good, it has lots of room for upgrades. The Aeris has a usual crew of three, although it can be flown by a single pilot. It can carry 40 tons of cargo and has a very long range. Its only disadvantage is that the crew quarters are not very luxurious. Bed, toilette, washbasin and shower in nine squaremeters each. Four quarters are standard, three for the crew and one for a passenger. If necessary, the cargo bay can be used as additional passenger hold.
