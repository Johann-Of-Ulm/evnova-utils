It is said that all roads lead to Sol, and it is literally true, as the old Council Hypergate system originated here.  The Kane band houses most of Earth's serious shipyard activity.  There are no greater shipyards anywhere in known space; in fact, Sigma Shipyards actually owns 62% of the band surface.  The Moon has taken a back seat, and has been strip-mined for centuries."	"•"

Materials and parts produced on Viking below are shipped up and assembled on base.  However, the primary purpose of this base is to provide a home for the people who have to keep track of the Federation military on a day-to-day basis.

Nesre himself was the exception to the New Babylonian rule, living in modest surroundings after his term of office, and people today still take pride in living on the same planet where the greatest hero of the Colonial Council ended his days.  There are any number of hawkers and street guides who will tell you their theories about his assassination, or show you the \qlocation\q of his grave, but most are obviously implausible.  The real location of his final resting place has been lost in the growth of seven hundred years of civilization..."	"•"

To make matters worse, it's on the vital southern border that the Federation shares with the Auroran Empire.  Spacedock III has seen an enormous amount of action in the years since it was commissioned, and has recently been upgraded to hold the latest station-class blaster cannons.  Ingress and egress from the station are much more difficult than is normal for this model of Federation Battlestation, due to the ion storms that regularly sweep this area of space, and also because of security procedures designed to weed out Auroran infiltrators."

The Polaris now control much of the area to the east of the Federation that used to be in the hands of the Colonial Council, due to the slow withdrawal of the Council into the core worlds during the collapse.  Port Kane now occupies the vital intersection between the Auroran Empire, the Polaris and the Federation.  What little trade and diplomacy is conducted between these three governments occurs here.  Port Kane also holds the dubious distinction of being the furthest Primary system from the Federation core worlds.  It is something of a backwater, but it's cosmopolitan enough to have good port services, full of decent outfitters.  It's also the gateway to many a \qspecialist\q transaction, if you know where to look."	"•"

While New Babylon in the Nesre Primus system is the planet that every civilian aspires to live on, New England is where all those who strive to protect the Federation from all enemies, inside and out, hope to end their days.  Its closeness to Sol enables these former service-men and women, who have made their home here, to keep up to date with all the news and events affecting the Federation they love and its surroundings.  It also enables the Federation to call upon their many years of wisdom and experience in times of emergency."	"•"

After many years of struggle, they made their home here. They decided that they wanted to leave behind everything they had grown up with, and slowly they, and their descendants, evolved a peaceful rural society. They have become an artistic, cultured, and  hospitable people, but despite this remember that this world was colonized by people who had been forced to fight their entire lives to survive.  Their skills have been passed down to the Wild Geese, perhaps the single toughest mercenary unit in known space, known for their fierce independence and near-suicidal bravery."	"•"

Home to the Krim-Hwa religious organization, this cult is a fusion of many old Earth religions.  This has created a culture of gentle, peace-loving people who spread their faith throughout the galaxy like the ivy winds its way through the hedgerow.  Krim-Hwa monks are welcome anywhere in Federation space, where they minister to the sick and dying, and do charitable works.  Led by His Eminence Cardinal Feroque deIgni, Krim-Hwa has maintained good relations with all other major powers in the galaxy even through some of the more turbulent times it has seen.  Las Vegas is a farming colony, producing a significant fraction of the wheat crop of the Federation."	"•"

You can feel the heat through your bio-suit, and the sludge squishes under your feet as you walk through the deserted streets of the spaceport.  There is nothing of worth here, and even if there was it would never pass through your ship's biofilters."	"•"

Most passenger ferries destined for the Nesre Primus system dock here instead of the blue-green planet below.  Inter-orbital shuttles and cargo drones account for 90% of the traffic to and from Spacedock IV and New Babylon, and merchants usually have their head offices here rather than groundside.  The spaceport itself is very well maintained, but it is obviously an old station, one of the first of the Federation style to be built.  Regularly upgraded, it performs a vital role in housing the military barracks for this sector, supplying patrols for the outlying systems in an attempt to weed out pirates and rebel insurgents."	"•"

Its crust is still molten in many places, and volcanoes and earthquakes bring many valuable minerals to the molten surface of this world, via magma currents, and the mining here has been profitable for the small concerns that operate on this rugged world.  Ironically, Hargen teems with vegetative life, however, and the atmosphere is quite breathable.  Many of the plants here have remarkable properties (due to the strains of living in such a place), and there are many farmers who sell rare crops to buyers across the galaxy.  Medical companies in particular order many kilotons of produce per year."	"•"

They named it Xyon, after the Krim-Hwa god of peace and tranquillity.  Xyon produces the lion's share of bioregenerative medicines for the Federation, which are refined via industrial catalyst from the plankton that live in Xyon's surface spanning ocean.  There are some signs of prior habitation as well, and domes of plasticized water can be found dotted on the surface of Xyon near the poles.  Old Council records reveal the minutes of a session of the Circle of Ministers where one of the Vell-os representatives described the travels of her ancestors across the disc of the galaxy to find a new home.

The universe can be a harsh place, and anything that gives your ship an edge is a 'must have'.\r\r\qFor starters,\q he continues, waving towards the outfits, \qyou should certainly consider buying a map of the local systems; knowing where you're going saves you a lot of hassles of back-tracking and stuffing around.  Other outfits that are often 'must-haves' are the battery pack and the solar panels, as you can never have enough stored energy, and when you run out of energy, your solar panels quickly become a life-saver.\r\r\qMany pilots,\q he adds, indicating some software upgrades being hawked off to your left, \qalso find modifying their sensor software very helpful, especially the 'Gravimetric Sensors', 'IFF Decoder' and 'Auto Recharger' upgrades.  The first allows you to gain a better picture of the size of ships around you, the second will show you whether or not surrounding ships, planets and stations are friendly towards you or not and the last means you don't have to remember to refuel, it automatically does it for you.\r\r\qAs for the rest,\q he gestures dismissively, \qhave a look around and see what you like, and what you can afford.  Be aware that the Federation government restricts a lot of outfits, either by requiring you to buy a license to get them, or by slapping a military ban on them.\r\r\qIncidentally,\q he finishes quietly, \qdon't think that this list of outfits is the be-all and end-all.  Earth and the Kane Band do offer a fair range of services, but they certainly don't offer you everything.

The burly individual knocks you to the ground, and as you stand to give the offensive ruffian a piece of your mind (if not a piece of your boot) you notice that the man was sent flying your way by a red bearded giant fighting on the far side of the bar.  As you watch, a number of men attack him, only to be beaten back by his prodigious strength.  A man comes at him from behind, smashing a bar stool over his head.  He staggers and begins to stumble.  His sneaky attacker begins to draw a knife, and you feel as if you should help the man before he is stabbed in the back in a cowardly attack.\r\rYou quickly jump into action, smashing your fist into the other man's face.  He falls backward as your fist comes away stained with blood.  The giant shakes his head, and with a roar launches himself at the remaining ruffians.  As you watch the fight ends in a quick and brutal flurry of blows.  In a matter of seconds the floor is strewn with unconscious bodies.  The man turns to you and offers his huge hand.\r\r\qThanks for your help,\q he says in a thick brogue.  \qCan I get you a drink?\q\r\rYou nod your assent and he turns to a dazed looking barman and orders two drinks.  You make a mental note to not drink in Dockside bars any more, and turn your attention to the man beside you.  He stands about six and a half feet tall, and looks as if he could pull apart Leviathans with his bare hands.  He has a shock of bright red carrot colored hair, and very pale skin.  He turns to you and hands you a huge drink, as black as pitch and as thick as fresh cream.\r\rHe raises his glass to you in a silent salute, and takes a long pull on his drink.  You follow suit, and are surprised by the thick bitter taste that fills your mouth.  It is at once revolting and enticing, and you don't quite know what to make of it.  You guess that you should be polite and finish it, but you don't know if you'll be able.\r\rMany hours later you and your new friend, Michaleen Houge, stagger from the bar.  The manager slams the door behind you and locks it quickly, and you get the distinct impression that he was not happy that the two loudest patrons were also the last to leave.  You head back towards the docks, when Michaleen curses loudly.  You follow his gaze as best you can, and see a heavily modified Thunderhead being locked down by the port authorities.  Michaleen shouts abuses at them in a strange tongue, but it makes no difference.  Before they leave, they give him a notice to the effect that he had outstanding storage debts, and that his ship was impounded until he pays them back.\r\r\qAh, but that would have to be the life of a wild rover,\q he sighs wistfully, waving an unsteady hand at his locked ship. \qI spent all me money on whiskies and beer, and now I've none to get me ship out of hock.\q\r\rHe slumps down next to the ship and puts his head in his hand.  Your heart goes out to him, and you ask if there is any way that you can help him.  He explains that he has to be in New Ireland in the Tuatha system before the end of the month so he can be best man in his cousins nuptials.  He says that if you can give him a lift, you can stay for the wedding and the party after.  Apparently one is very serious, and the other involves a white dress.

You ask him why he doesn't seem to have to pay for anything, and he looks at you in surprise.\r\r\qWhy, don't you know who we are here in New Ireland,\q he answers, slightly surprised.  \qWe're the Wild Geese, the best mercenary organization in the Universe.  We fight for the best pay and the best causes, and we never lose.  I'm one of the Geese, so I am more responsible for the income of New Ireland than many others here.

I'll cover any debt when I die.\q\r\rYou ask him further about the Geese, and you realize that most of the famous battles of the past have had the Geese somewhere in the field.  They have a long tradition of being the savior of their employers troops, and when the day is all but lost, and most men are ready to break, the Wild Geese find a special reserve and push on, often winning the day single-handedly.  Or at least that is the way that Michaleen tells it.  By the time he has finished his explanations, many of the other patrons have begun telling their stories.  They all involve fighting, women, and lots of drinking.  By the time you leave the bar, you have a deep wish that you'd had the fortune to be born on New Ireland, or the Sol homeland, Ireland itself.  At least then you could lay claim to this rich tradition of warriors and heroes.  You tell Michaleen, who laughs until his face hurts.\r\r\qMusha,\q he waggles a finger at you \qIt's talk like that that'll cause folks to not let you leave.

Cut-throats intercepted his shipments, and the Federation made legal trade almost impossible, with their export taxes, and their exorbitant charges for escorts and other protection.  The Federation bled the small companies dry with their tithes, while cultivating the old Leviathans and their rich hereditary owners.  They maintained their monopoly with their kickbacks.\r\r\qSeeing as Unions and Associations had been outlawed, yer father decided to form a secret organization.  'The Association of Free Traders' was formed.  We shared information and risk by travelling in our own convoys with ships modified to carry armaments.  We built our own shipyard, out in the Galactic North where I was chief designer.\r\r\qIt wasn't that we were criminals.  We just realized that the system wasn't fair for people like us, and that it was our duty to find ways to circumvent its holds.

His ship 'Unrelenting' was one of the greatest ships I or anyone had ever built.  She was a heavily modified Carrier, with a better weapons platform and more powerful engines.  Slowly we began to lose more and more shipments to the Federation, and yer father sent McGowan to investigate why.  Yer father had seen his smarts and put him on the Board of Advisers, the controlling body of the Association.  McGowan organized a meeting between yer father, the Board of Advisers and the other privateers who hadn't joined the Association.  He said that they had information vital to the Association's survival.\r\r\qSo the 'Unrelenting' and the others exited hyperspace at the meeting place, a far off system inhabited by no bugger, only to find the mother of all Federation battle-fleets waiting for them.\r\r\qIt was a trap, and McGowan had betrayed us all.  Yer father marshalled a fierce last stand, allowing most of the fleets to jump to safety, but was killed in the process along with yer mum and almost every friend I had ever known.  I was one of the few to make it off 'Unrelenting' alive, and I brought ye with me.\r\r\qI vowed that they would be avenged, but I knew that I was not the man to do it.  My responsibility was to keep the promise I made to yer mother, to keep ye alive, so that ye may take yer place at the head of the organization of Free Traders.

There's one in just about every port throughout the universe.

If you want a better ship, you go and buy it, but it isn't always so straightforward.  You see, ships aren't always available, what with shipping delays, and all that.  So sometimes the ship you're looking for might not be around.  And then you have the second-hand ships that other captains are trying to sell to you.  Be very careful of any cheap second-hand ships, as they tend to be nowhere near as good as those that are brand new.  Having said that, there are some very good second-hand deals out there, ships that due to careful maintenance, and clever upgrades, are far more capable than anything you would buy 'off the shelf' so to speak, so don't discount second-hand ships altogether.\r\r\qA good place to start,\q he comments a little tiredly, \qis by upgrading from the Shuttle to the Heavy Shuttle.  It's nearly as capable in space, and it carries more energy, which allows you to jump further, and also a fair bit more cargo and weapon space.\r\r\qAgain,\q he continues off-handedly, \qlike the outfits, the Federation puts certain limits on the availability of various ships.  Some require you get ahold of a license, others are only available with individual military approval.  Regardless, before you buy any ship, make sure you check out all the information on every ship you are looking at before you make your decision.\q"	"•"

Cut-throats intercepted his shipments, and the Federation made legal trade almost impossible, with their export taxes, and their exorbitant charges for escorts and other protection.  The Federation bled the small companies dry with their tithes, while cultivating the old Leviathans and their rich hereditary owners.  They maintained their monopoly with their kickbacks.\r\r\qSeeing Unions and Associations had been outlawed, yer father decided to form a secret organization.  'The Association of Free Traders' was formed.  We shared information and risk by travelling in our own convoys with ships modified to carry armaments.  We built our own shipyard, out in the Galactic North where I was chief designer.\r\r\qIt wasn't that we were criminals.  We just realized that the system wasn't fair for people like us, and that it was our duty to find ways to circumvent its holds.

His ship 'Unrelenting' was one of the greatest ships I or anyone had ever built.  She was a heavily modified Carrier, with a better weapons platform and more powerful engines.  Slowly we began to lose more and more shipments to the Federation, and yer father sent McGowan to investigate why.  Your father had seen his smarts and put him on the Board of Advisers, the controlling body of the Association.  McGowan organized a meeting between yer father, the Board of Advisers and the other privateers who hadn't joined the Association.  He said that they had information vital to the Association's survival.\r\r\qSo the 'Unrelenting' and the others exited hyperspace at the meeting place, a far off system inhabited by no bugger, only to find the mother of all Federation battle-fleets waiting for them.\r\r\qIt was a trap, and McGowan had betrayed us all.  Yer father marshalled a fierce last stand, allowing most of the fleets to jump to safety, but was killed in the process along with yer mum and almost every friend I had ever known.  I was one of the few to make it off 'Unrelenting' alive, and I bought you with me.\r\r\qI vowed that they would be avenged, but I knew that I was not the man to do it.  My responsibility was to keep the promise I made to yer mother, to keep ye alive, so that ye may take yer place at the head of the Organization of free traders.

The space {G\qjock\q \qchick\q} lifestyle is a fairly lonely one, with months between seeing old friends, and you are more than happy to chat away for a while with him.  It turns out that he is an Auroran living in Federation space.  When he told you, you looked at him somewhat skeptically, but once he explained that he was watched by the government very carefully, and had to log all his travel and movements, you can see that this might be possible.  Charengo has been living in Fed space since his House cast him out.  Your limited knowledge of the Auroran lifestyle gives you enough of an idea not to question him further; these things are always a matter of honor, and best left alone.\r\rDuring the course of the night it becomes apparent that Charengo is something of an entrepreneur, and has organized for a number of Federation citizens to go to Hourglass and hunt the dreaded Cunjo.  He has a number of expatriate Auroran warriors to act as guides, and enough weapons to destroy a small Federation battle group.  He has run a number of successful hunts, but has run into a snag.  His regular pilot was killed when a Cunjo ripped him to pieces.  So now he has a party ready to leave, but no one to get them there.\r\rSuddenly, a light comes to his eyes, and you can all but see a light bulb appear next to him.  \qSay,\q he asks, \qwhat are you doing tomorrow?  Do you feel up to ferrying us to Hourglass and dropping us off back at Earth?  It might be a little risky.  Lately, it seems the Cunjo population has increased, and a number of them have been mating at erratic times.  However, we have plenty of weapons, so if it gets too hairy, you'll be well covered by me and my team.\q\r\rYou look at him in a mixture of disbelief.  You have never seen a Cunjo, but you really don't want to.\r\rCharengo sees your expression, smiles and leans closer, \qThere is big money in this.  If you do it for me, I'll always be in your debt.  And I'll pay you 75,000.  You won't have to go on surface for very long, and you won't even have to leave your ship.  Even in mating season, Cunjo can't tear through metal.\q\r\rWhat do you say?"	"•"

All around there is dense forest, and the undergrowth is just starting to cover a huge number of deep craters.  You set down, and the sensors are going wild.  As soon as you do, Charengo and his team leap out of the hatch, brandishing their weapons with gusto.  Behind them come the clients, three looking like they should be wearing brown underpants, the fourth eyeing the undergrowth intently.  You cycle the hatch closed and watch.  A Cunjo suddenly breaks from the undergrowth, flying through the air to attack one of Charengo's men.  At least it would have, if a rocket hadn't plowed into its chest before detonating the beast into a rapidly expanding pink vapor cloud.  The public servants leap to the ground, pointing their weapons in every direction at once.\r\rCharengo lays about with a continuous laser, and in the space of a few minutes the clearing you landed in is three times the size.  His men set up the mines and sentry lasers, and the camp takes shape.\r\rYou decide that you might try this game for yourself, seeing as you are here.  You check your blaster, and hail Charengo to tell him you are coming down for a look.\r\rNo sooner have you stepped outside the hatch than the surrounding forest comes alive with the sounds of Cunjos calling to each other.\r\r\qLook out!\q Charengo yells.  \qThe Cunjo are going to rush through here!  Seems like our safe landing site has become a mating ground!\q\r\rYou haul your blaster from its holster, trying to look everywhere at once.  The underbrush erupts, and around 10 Cunjo burst from the foliage.  You leap to the side, snapping off blaster bolts at the first Cunjo you see.  It moves faster than you have ever seen anything move, but enough of your fire hits it to put it down.  A sudden premonition of doom sweeps through you, and you spin to see a Cunjo scant feet from you.  It pounces forward, stabbing its long claws into your arms.  You gasp in pain as its claws bite deep, and the Cunjo roars into your face.  It's fetid breath makes your head swim, but you manage to keep your wits about you enough to raise your blaster and blow its head off.  You collapse, and through a deepening haze see Charengo run towards you, blasting from the hip.  Then, blackness...\r\rYou stay on Hourglass for four days, recovering enough from your wounds to pilot the ship back.  Charengo is glad to take off as soon as you are able.  Apparently this trip was hotter than was originally expected.  The public servants never fired their weapons, but still had some 'very manly' holoshots taken with killed Cunjos.  The fourth client made some kills on his own, but they all looked on in disbelief when Charengo and the guides explained that in the Auroran Empire, warriors hunt Cunjo with hand to hand weapons.  All too soon, you have packed up and are heading home."	"•"

In a strange place called a cemetery, Michaleen's coffin is lowered into the ground.  A man sits and plays a strange pipe instrument, and for the first time you hear music made by something that is not electronic.  A mist rolls in, and it appears that the mourners are suspended in time, and that the moment has been frozen by some power beyond the control of man, so that it may accept the soul of the departed man with due reverence.  It is something that you will never forget, and the memory will always make you cry."	"•"

In battle, Flynn became a wild killing machine, hacking and slashing without fear.  Men fell before him like wheat before the scythe, and many turned and tried to flee.  Flynn pulled his pistol and he and his team wreaked a bloody vengeance upon their massed ranks, and it was over in less than an hour.

As you watch you see ten men rush him, only to be repulsed by him.  He moves in a way that you have seen no other man ever move.  He weaves around them as if he controlled their movements as well as his own, and that each step taken was part of some elaborate (and painful) dance.  By the time you begin to piece together what your eyes are telling you, the man has moved on further.  It is amazing to behold.\r\rWithin moments he has defeated the men.

Some situations require force, others non-force.  It is something I learned during my time with the Aurorans.  The House Heraan use a specific style of Martial Arts; the Heron Style.  I am a master, but I have started teaching my men here a variation of it.  It is an amazing system.\q\r\rYou nod in agreement, and ask what the principal basis is.\r\r\qIn learning Heron style, you are taught to read and direct the \qWeave\q of combat.  Subconsciously, all of us fight to a pattern and rhythm.  Heron Style teaches us to detect it and control it.  It isn't so much that you defeat your opponent, but he defeats himself, if you force the \qweave\q to do so.  It is hard to explain, but once felt, and mastered, it makes all combat easier, from one on one, to mammoth battles between hundreds of ships.  There is one teacher Karlaekar, to whom the most promising students are sent.  It is said he imprints the ability to read and control the \qweave\q on the student subconsciously.  This makes their \qweave\q unreadable, and therefore very dangerous.\q\r\rYou nod, even though most of what Flannigan has said escapes your understanding."	"•"

Burch) for his friendship, gifts, time and patience.  Beer is not enough to thank you, but it's all we have! ;) We really hope this is now the game you always wanted to make, Matt.\r\rATMOS offers very special thanks to Andrew Welch for hitting Dave over the head, being an unreadable internet entity and his tall stories of four wheel driving, wine and women.  We would also like to thank him for the foundation and ideas that went into the ATMOS_LASIK technology as it now appears in Nova.\r\rATMOS offers very special thanks to the Sutherland family (including Ralph's father, Mr. Slater), for their tireless efforts towards the project.  It wouldn't be as clean, concise or as well executed without them.  ATMOS particularly wants to thank Dr. Ralph Sutherland for his incredible suite of NovaTools, the half of which the world will never actually see, because they're far too dangerous. :D\r\rOh, and Eddie's Green Sauce. :D\r\rFun is fun!\r\r[-] Paul Pentecost:\r\rWe asked DalSoth if he had anyone to thank, and he said \qno.\q\r\r[-] Dafydd Williams:\r\rpipeline would like to thank Cathryn for more reasons than can be listed here.  His parents, for being awesome.  He would also like to thank some really daggy music that noone else likes.  The guys who did Babylon 5 don't suck.  The LightWave mailing list rules.  Dave would like to thank Phil for Barnaby and Farquar (for reasons of a personal nature).\r\rHe has many more things/people to thank, but can't remember them all.  You all rule.\r\r[-] Luke Smart:\r\rI'd like to take this little piece of a huge game to give you my personal thanks and wishes.  Firstly, I would like to thank my wife, Lisa, who has been a source of strength for me throughout the long years that we have been working on Nova.  She makes every day a dream come true, and without her I know that I wouldn't be writing this message.  When times were hard, she made them easier, and there is no other way to put it.  Next I would like to thank the other half of my waking life, the guys from ATMOS.  I saw more of them in the first twelve months of marriage than I saw of my wife!  Seeing anybody that much can be very hard, and I know that we have all had our ups and downs.  I also know that they make this the best job I have ever had, and their part in my life cannot be measured in terms of just friendship.  The ATMOS family have been there for me, through sickness and health, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for keeping the faith and producing the huge volume of work that is EV Nova.  Andrew Welch makes me smile more than he makes me frown, and despite the fact there have been times I have taken his name in vain, I know that the game that he pushed us to make is far better than any product we could have made without his input.  Matt Burch is a true code warrior, and he deserves huge amounts of praise for basically re-writing the code for Escape Velocity so that we could make Nova.  He also knows lots about beer.  Working and talking to him is a joy, and his message bank message always makes me smile.  Lastly, I would like to thank Mike and Liz Williams.  We have taken over rooms of their house, huge amounts of fridge space with beer, and hardly ever cleaned up after ourselves.  Their home has been our office, and their willingness to take us in and house the rowdy bunch of blokes that make up ATMOS has been a blessing.  The Boofhead Office takes up much of their own home, and I thank them for putting up with us.  Enjoy Nova, and remember, 24 beers in a carton, 24 hours in a day...coincidence, I don't bloody think so!\r\r[-] Jason Cook:\r\rCPL Ken Erlenbusch, who tragically took his own life on the 29th of Feb 2000 not 30 meters from where I stood.\r\rMy wife Angela, who patiently puts up with my never-ending late nights (and late mornings), and my comings and goings at all kinds of hours.\r\r[-] Stephen Chick:\r\rKristy Anthony, for her ideas, help, tolerance and love.\rHeavy Metal, for keeping me sane(ish).\rTechno, for making me jump.\rSector 9 and Think, for making me move.\rMP3, for hiding my CDs.\rForge & Anvil, for showing us that making games can be fun.\r\r[-] Scott Vardy:\r\r\qWhat have I done?!\q\r\rIt seems it must have been before the dawn of time now; that I was playing a popular little game called Escape Velocity and thought...  'Hmmm.  A Leviathan would be really nice for this game.\q  Well, four years later that ship is now called the Pegasus (yes, it really all started with that dumpy little spinning thing) and EV Nova has taken on a life and civilisation of its own. I would like to thank everyone in the ATMOS team for all of their precious time and blood in building concrete bridges from my fairyfloss flights of fervourous fantasy.  Thanks Dave for patiently re-engineering so many of my Scotty-munted ships (aren't polygons hard task masters?).  Thank you, Gail, for the company. Thanks, guys, for actually picking up and running with so much of the weird stuff I came up with in my creative stupour (pity about the TCTLIDS).  I would also like to personaly thank \qCoca Cola\q as I wouldn't drink Haagen, Cascade, Boags or any other of those forms of bottled piss.\r\rI'm looking forward to playing my game.\r\r[-] Philip Chick:\r\rPhil would like to thank champ for his handbags, and his parents for the hardware and software required for the project.\r\r[-] Matt Burch:\r\rIf there's one person in the world to whom I owe immense thanks for making my portion of Nova possible, it's my wife Mary. Without her constant love and support I would not have been able to pull off this massive piece of work and still hold on to all my marbles. For over a year and a half she has been my source of inspiration, tirelessly putting up with an near-infinite series of late nights and long weekends. Without her, there would be no Nova game engine.\r\rI'd also like to thank my parents for equipping me at a young age with the proper set of tools necessary to undertake and complete a project of this scope, and my brother for being a great sounding board for all these years.\r\rFinally, I'd like to thank all of ATMOS, the friends I've never met. Guys, I'm really proud to have been able to help bring your universe to life.\r\r----------\r\r\qNever let reality get in the way of a good story.\q \r          - Dr. Ralph"	"•"
