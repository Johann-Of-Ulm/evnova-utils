dësc	128	"Earth"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The Voinian war took its toll on the Earth and its resources. Large amounts of food must now be imported from First Centauri, along with the raw materials used in the factories which cover the face of the planet, churning out weapons and ships with which to fight the Voinians."	"•"
dësc	129	"First Centauri"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"First Centauri was both the first world set foot on and the first colonised by mankind. Today it is an important agricultural planet, supplying Earth with most of its food. First Centauri's economy is steadily expanding, as ever more colonists from Earth settle here."	"•"
dësc	130	"Pax"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"This station, once a jumping-off point for the Voinian war effort, supposedly seals the Earth-Voinian peace treaty and forms a diplomatic and trade link between the two governments. This treaty, however, while it has - arguably - ended all-out war, has not stopped the fighting - and a great deal of that fighting happens in the space outside Pax station."	"•"
dësc	132	"Atlantic Station"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Specially designed ships from Atlantic station dive down into the upper atmosphere of New Atlantic, scooping up gases which are refined into hyperspace fuel at Atlantic station. New Atlantic is mankind's main source of this vital raw material."	"•"
dësc	133	"New Prussia"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"New Prussia is a very ordinary world. Although briefly blockaded, it was for the most part untouched by the Voinian war and is neither heavily industrialised nor agriculturalised."	"•"
dësc	134	"New Riga"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The lucrative mines on New Riga have been the vital to the United Earth economy for almost a century now, taking the place of Earth's critically over-stretched natural resources at the critical moment. They are almost exhausted now, but occasionally a rich vein of ore is found and traders flock here."	"•"
dësc	135	"Troon"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"A desolate world. (Well what were you expecting, a hidden alien enclave?)"	"•"
dësc	136	"Outpost Alpha"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Outpost Alpha is a supply base for UE warship patrols in this sector of space. Situated in a direct line between the core worlds of mankind and the Voinian Empire, Outpost Alpha takes the brunt of all Voinian offensives."	"•"
dësc	137	"F-6129"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Around half a century ago, this world was host to a peaceful, prosperous human colony. Then came the Voinians, devastating this world along with many others, and obliterating the colony. Amidst the chaos of the Voinian War, even the name once given to this beautiful planet was lost. Today it is located far too close to the border to be re-settled."	"•"
dësc	138	"Outpost Gamma"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"This moon serves as a base for UE forces in this area, protecting the oft-victimised world of Verril Prime beyond. Outpost Gamma's commander, d'Erlon, is renowned for his unconventionally aggressive tactics against the Voinians. To date, however, all his gambles have paid off."	"•"
dësc	140	"Verril Prime"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The original colony on Verril Prime was destroyed during the Voinian war. Now that the area is a little safer colonists are slowly trickling back, but it is a slow process. Still, thanks to this fact Verril Prime remains mostly unexplored and untamed, and there are many natural wonders to be seen here."	"•"
dësc	141	"Paaren"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The self-proclaimed 'second city' of humanity, Paaren is a luxury world inhabited by anyone with the inclination and enough cash to pay their own way off Earth. A large planet, there is easily enough room on Paaren to keep the luxury-residential areas and the industrial spaceport and shipyard zones well apart."	"•"
dësc	142	"Paaren Station"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"In the darkest hour of the Voinian War, all the signs suggested that Earth would fall to the Voinians. Plans were laid for partial evacuation and a general retreat to Paaren. To this end Paaren station was built as a last line of defence. Before it was finished, however, the Voinians had been defeated at the Battle of Sol and were being forced back. The construction of the station was abandoned."	"•"
dësc	143	"Outpost Theta"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Outpost Theta is the most remote of all the outposts on the Voinian frontier, set up at great expense, and after several failed attempts, to guard against the threat of the Voinians outflanking human space and attacking via Saalia. Isolated and distant from goings-on back home, the personnel here welcome news from the rare traders who pass through."	"•"
dësc	144	"Mars"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Despite many ambitious proposed projects, Mars has never been colonised, and remains a barren, all but lifeless red rock."	"•"
dësc	145	"Luna"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The 'Lunicus' moonbase was set up to be a military command centre during the Voinian War, when it served as a base for the massive Sol fighter-defence fleet. Though the technology of the base is now relatively primitive, the factories here can still produce modern equipment, and UE naval high command is still located here."	"•"
dësc	147	"Saalia"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Mountainous Saalia is famous for one thing in particular - its brandy. Saalian brandy is famed (or rather notorious) all over human space, and perhaps beyond. In spite of strict UE trading regulations on its distribution, it is rumoured that off-world connoisseurs will pay a high price for even a small shipment."	"•"
dësc	148	"Knox"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The small world of Knox is the administrative headquarters of the UE fleet, excepting the border forces, commanded from the frontier outposts and Luna. In this less hazardous environment, staff officers arrange postings and organise supply shipments to worlds all over UE space."	"•"
dësc	150	"Crockett"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Crockett is the headquarters of Frontier Express, an informal organisation of experienced traders who are exclusively chartered by the UE navy to deliver supplies to outposts on the UE-Voinian frontier."	"•"
dësc	151	"New Chicago"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"New Chicago is the headquarters of Stellar Corp, the formidably powerful corporation which has come, through devious manoeuvring over the century and a half of its existence, to dominate the majority of interplanetary trade throughout human space. Although no allegations against it have ever been substantiated, Stellar Corp. has an oft-exagerrated reputation for unscrupulous business tactics."	"•"
dësc	152	"Telnan"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The mines of Telnan are extremely dangerous - only the most desperate of spacers will take work as a miner here, and most of the work-force is made up of convicted felons from Earth. Almost every week brings news of another fatal or near-fatal mining accident on Telnan. The ore mined here is so valuable and pure, however, that to leave it would be totally economically unviable."	"•"
dësc	153	"New Tokyo"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"New Tokyo is a major industrial world, renowned for high productivity, quality and efficiency. New Tokyo's factories supply a lot of vital equipment to newly-colonised planets, and the planet's shipyards construct a considerable proportion of civilian human vessels."	"•"
dësc	154	"New Calcutta"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Originally the site of a hopeful, thriving young colony, New Calcutta was recently struck by a mysterious disease which wiped out half of the population, along with much of the world's once abundant plant-life. The remainder of the colonists, planet-bound to minimise the risk of the contamination spreading, are desperately fighting for survival, with the help of regular runs of medical supplies."	"•"
dësc	155	"UE Listening Post 2A"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The United Earth government set up this series of listening posts to warn of other alien incursions. The data they collect is conveyed regularly back to UE naval command by message pod."	"•"
dësc	156	"UE Listening Post 2E"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The United Earth government set up this series of listening posts to warn of other alien incursions. The data they collect is conveyed regularly back to UE naval command by message pod."	"•"
dësc	157	"Molos"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Molos is the United Earth ColRegDep's newest colony, and as such is currently in the midst of a frenzy of settlement, as supplies and colonists and messages are rushed between here, Earth and elsewhere."	"•"
dësc	158	"New Rome"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"New Rome's weird and unique life-forms make it a popular tourist world. Although for the average citizen interstellar travel is still expensive and unusual - even after nearly two centuries of space-flight, many on Earth never dream of leaving the homeworld - prices are steadily coming down, and New Rome is a favoured resort for once-in-a-lifetime space-travellers."	"•"
dësc	159	"New Taranto"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"While Earth has become a warship-producing machine, New Tokyo churns out vast quantities of freight-carriers, and many worlds have their own small shipyard, the moon of New Taranto is unique in being utterly devoted the art of ship-crafting. All the most revolutionary and brilliant designers reside here. It is believed that Anna Balashova herself, who designed both the UE Fighter and its complement the Carrier, has retired here to work on the ship which will be her legacy to the galaxy."	"•"
dësc	161	"Avann Outpost"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The Voinians grudgingly built these outposts when they were forced to accept that the war was becoming dead-locked. Although United Earth forces are more rarely on the offensive than the Voinians, outposts like this one are a vital line-of-defence when such deadly, lightning raids do occur."	"•"
dësc	162	"F-9056"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Certain signs suggest that this desolate world was once home to a small colony of one race or another. It is obvious, however, that the planet has long been forgotten and ignored by both sides."	"•"
dësc	163	"Ylynn Outpost"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"This moon serves as a base for Voinian attacks on United Earth space. By already established Voinian custom, all major offensives gather here to prepare for the assault."	"•"
dësc	165	"F-6104"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"A barren planet, whose surface is marred by crater scars inflicted by stray rockets and missiles."	"•"
dësc	168	"Obron Outpost"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"This Voinian frontier outpost serves the twin purpose of guarding the border and keeping an eye on the potentially rebellious neighbouring systems of Gualon and Gamur."	"•"
dësc	170	"Huron"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Huron is unique among UE colony worlds, having been independent of all major powers until it accepted the protection of the UE fleet after the Voinian War, by which it was barely affected. These days, the UE navy, taxed enough by the Voinian war, is hard-pressed to keep Huron defended from renegade raids, while the resources of Huron, considerable as it was able to grow and prosper while other worlds were subjected to the Voinian onslaught, continue to go towards fortifying the frontier."	"•"
dësc	171	"UE Listening Post 2G"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The United Earth government set up this series of listening posts to warn of other alien incursions. The data they collect is conveyed regularly back to UE naval command by message pod."	"•"
dësc	173	"Apollo"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"It is almost always day on Apollo, due to the brightness of both the sun and the huge, almost sun-like gas giant of Helios which the moon orbits. Thanks to this cosmological quirk (and various bio-engineering techniques) the farms of Apollo are extremely productive. The moon is, however, currently suffering from renegade attacks, having recently been abandoned by the United Earth government, who lacked the resources to properly defend it."	"•"
dësc	174	"Troub"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"An uninhabited, somewhat purple, world. Troub's mysterious atmosphere and intriguing landscape look as though they might conceal untold sinister secrets. Unfortunately you are not at leisure to explore."	"•"
dësc	175	"F-909"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"An unpleasant, barely habitable world, whose surface is constantly ravaged by storm-clouds composed of all manner of noxious chemicals."	"•"
dësc	176	"New Alcatraz"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"New Alcatraz, always a world on the verge of criminality, was the first planet to declare independence from United Earth, whose ships had never had much power this deep in the Proxima Nebula. The small world quickly became, and remains, a focal point for every misfit and trouble-maker in human space. One way or another, few captains make more than one trip to New Alcatraz."	"•"
dësc	178	"F-4067"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"An inhospitable, desert world, which only a few small, vicious crabs appear to inhabit."	"•"
dësc	179	"UE Listening Post 2J"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The United Earth government set up this series of listening posts to warn of other alien incursions. The data they collect is conveyed regularly back to UE naval command by message pod."	"•"
dësc	180	"Thehir"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The twin planets of Thehir and Gribn became independent on the basis of their extremely mutually profitable arrangement: Gribn processes the ore mined on Thehir, and amongst the other products is mining equipment which is sold back to Thehir. The only difficulty is getting traders to fly the pirate-infested space between the two planets; the Thehir-Gribn run is known as the miser's funeral, for although running costs are temptingly low, as no hyper-jumps are necessary, the Hatuli system is exceptionally dangerous."	"•"
dësc	181	"Gribn"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"The twin planets of Thehir and Gribn became independent on the basis of their extremely mutually profitable arrangement: Gribn processes the ore mined on Thehir, and amongst the other products is mining equipment which is sold back to Thehir.

dësc	184	"Iothe Prime"	"Override Data 1"	-1	""	0x0000	"Iothe Prime's founders included a large number of skilled technicians and engineers, who had pooled their skills and resources in order to leave Earth.
