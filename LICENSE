NovaConText.txt was generated from the data files of Escape Velocity Nova[1] 1.1.1. These original data files are (C) Ambrosia Software[2], in collaboration with ATMOS. The text file was generated using ConText/ResStore[3], (C) Ralph and Roger Sutherland.

EVCConText.txt and EVOConText.txt were generated from the data files of the ports 'EV Classic for Nova' and 'EV Override for Nova', as released by 'Guy'[4] on the Ambrosia forums[5]. Original EV Classic and EV Override are (C) Ambrosia Software, in collaboration with Matt Burch and Peter Carthwright, respectively. 

MinersConText.txt was generated from the Miners total conversion plugin, by 'Arion' on the Ambrosia forums. The plugin appears to be no longer online anywhere. 

FHConText.txt was generated from Guy's port to Nova of the Frozen Heart total conversion for EV Override. Original Frozen Heart plugin is (C) Martin Turner.

The file "guy's pilot format.txt" is an attempt to reverse engineer the EV Nova pilot format, and was downloaded from Guy's web site. The file "pilot format.txt" is a previous attempt to reverse engineer the pilot format by myself, Dave Vasilevsky, based on the specification for EV Classic pilot files[6].
